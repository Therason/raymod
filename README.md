- Tweak media queries for mobile views and accessibility scaling (navbar may be too small,)
- Design gallery page better :D
- Tweak gallery page exit animations (doesn't scale well when number of posts increases due to staggerChildren)
- Convert to SPA? 
- Smooth scrolling with Lenis?
- BigWindow component as a modal?
